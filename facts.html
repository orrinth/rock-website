                        Igneous rocks can easily be identified through the bubbles and holes in a rock.
                        Of course, not all igneous rocks look like that. Some are smooth as well.
                        That's because they are the result of magma or lava being cooled and hardened.
                        It's lava when it erupts from a volcano, but magma in the depths of the earth.

                    <p class="description">
                        Sedimentary rocks are called sedimentary rocks because they are literally made of
                        smaller pieces of rock called sediment. Sediments come from other rocks and are 
                        grouped together through weathering and erosion. Soon, these groups of sediments 
                        layer on top of one another, and time packs them together into a sedimentary rock.

                    <p class="description">
                        Metamorphic rocks are formed through heat and pressure, but there has to be enough
                        of both. Of course, these rocks are made in the depths of the earth because that's 
                        where the heat and pressure are. However, in order for a metamorphic rock to become 
                        so, the rock before this phase can't melt through the heat. If it does, it will not 
                        become metamorphic.
